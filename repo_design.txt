This is an attempt to formalize the structure of the repo, before i start working on it.


Pipleline

Step 1. - Read in niigz images and labels
Step 2. - Convert to numpy files of images and labels which will be input to the network
Step 3. - Train the network
Step 4. - Get Predictions
Step 5. - Convert Predictions to image format.


folder structure

This will be one folder outside the main code-- 
main_code/ data/

#original images       #after extracting patches
data/images/image      data/patches/images/
data/images/masks	   data/patches/masks/



'''
Break down of step 1
'''
1. First convert the niigz file to a numpy file so this numpy file may be of shape(x, 128,128,128) and place it in a folder
2. Read every slice of this numpy file and store it as a separate numpy file of shape (128,128,128)
